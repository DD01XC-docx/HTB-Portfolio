Welcome to my Hack The Box (HTB) portfolio. This repository documents my progress in penetration testing and cybersecurity through HTB machines, challenges, and labs. Each entry includes write-ups, tools used, scripts developed, and personal notes.

This project serves as both a personal learning log and a showcase of practical skills in offensive security. All machines and challenges documented here have been completed on Hack The Box under its Terms of Service.
